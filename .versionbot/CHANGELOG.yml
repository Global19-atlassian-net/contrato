        Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it only checks
        for

        existence of a field. There are times when we want to combine conditions
        in order

        to generate something as part of a blueprint, without defining a
        completely separate

        blueprint for it (like generating network config schema if a dt has a
        wifi chip or

        a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

        This adds support to specify a filter in the blueprint selector.
        This filter is a json schema, and only components are selected that
        match this schema.

      subject: 'Feature: Add support for skhema filters in blueprint selectors'
    - author: Andreas Fitzek
      body: |-
        This adds a sequence method to Blueprints, which will build a path
        to the most advanced version of the combosition of the blueprint.
        The steps in the path will work in a way that all requirements of
        each contract are satisfied at all time and each step will only
        increment the version of one component.
        This is only true for non infinite components atm, components that
        are added to the result of the blueprint by an infinite selector, will
        just be filled up with whatever is available, so that path algorithm
        only operates on the finite selectors.
        This also add semver range version matching for requirements and
        selectors.

        The `version` field in selectors can now hold the `latest`
        keyword, which will mean, that the selector will only collect
        the latest X versions of the component. X is the minimum of the
        cardinality of the selector and the available contracts.
